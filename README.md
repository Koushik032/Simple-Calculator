A simple interest calculator is a tool used to calculate the interest earned or paid on a principal amount over a specific period at a fixed interest rate. Simple interest is one of the most basic forms of interest calculation, where the interest amount is based only on the initial principal, not on accumulated interest.

Formula for Simple Interest
The formula to calculate simple interest (SI) is:

SI = (𝑃 × 𝑅 × 𝑇) /100

Where:
P = Principal amount (the initial sum of money)
R = Annual interest rate (as a percentage)
T = Time period (in years)
Components of a Simple Interest Calculator

Principal (P):
The initial amount of money that is either invested or borrowed.

Interest Rate (R):
The percentage of the principal that is paid as interest for a specific period (usually annually).

Time Period (T):
The duration for which the money is invested or borrowed, typically measured in years.

Simple Interest (SI):
The amount of interest generated over the period, calculated using the formula above.

Total Amount (A):
The sum of the principal and the interest. It can be calculated as:
𝐴 = 𝑃 + SI
A = P + (P × R × T) / 100
